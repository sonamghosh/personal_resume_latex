\section{Academic \\ Projects} 
\underline{Transistor Amplifier Design Project }: In a group of two individuals, we designed, simulated, and built a transistor amplifier using Bipolar Junction Transistors based on given gain, frequency, I/O resistance specifications  \\
\underline{Cyclic Load Tester}: In a team of five, we designed and built a cyclic load tester to apply repeated stress on metals using a sound woofer, power amplifier, and arduino connected load cell. \\
\underline{MATLAB Personal Portfolio GUI}: In a team of three, we created a functional GUI which gave the user a stock portfolio for choosing stocks that were analyzed via markowitz mean-variance analysis.
