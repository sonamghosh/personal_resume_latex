\section{Experience}
{\bf Quantum Computing Researcher,} Quantum Communication \& Measurement Lab \hfill  \textbf{\textit{F17/S18}}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -0.1 pt
\item Defended Senior Honors Thesis on demonstrating the potential of a linear-optical system to implement quantum simulations of a molecular system
\item Constructing \& simulating the Hamiltonian, calculating the eigenstates/eigenvalues, and photon quantum walks of a optical benzene setup of connected directionally unbiased optical multiports.
\end{itemize}



 {\bf Signal Processing Engineer Intern,} MITRE Corp. Bedford, MA \hfill \textbf{\textit{Summer 17/F17/SP18}}
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -0.5 pt  % reduce space between items
 \item Developed Python classes and scripts related to Fault Generation in PNT applications.
 \item Developed C++ Physics model for PNT application.
 \end{itemize}

 
 
{\bf Volunteer Research Assistant,} BUSAT Group, Boston, MA\hfill  \textbf{\textit{Summer 2016}}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -0.1pt %reduce space between items
\item Part of the Electrical team responsible for the solar power system powering the ANDESITE minisatellite
\item Assisted with testing efficacy of solar cell circuit designs and analyzing their effectiveness 
\item Tested RF sensors with several others with pre-made Python script to observe efficacy of signals being sent, received or lost
\end{itemize}


{\bf Research Assistant,} Ultrafast Optics Lab BU, Boston, MA \hfill \textbf{\textit{Fall 2015/Spring 2016}}
			\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
