\section{Technical \\ Projects} 
\textbf{\underline{MakeMIT 2018 CameraPiano}}: Developed system where an individual with a camera can turn any surface into a playable piano. Utilized \textbf{OpenCV} computer vision tools in \textbf{Python} to detect fingers and play music notes. Future work involves scaling system and \textbf{data analytics}.\\
\textbf{\underline{MakeHarvard 2018 Triangulation Person Detector}}: Developed system to turn off the lights in a room if a person leaves via the triangulated distance from Wi-Fi beacons. Created an app in \textbf{Java} to acquire Wi-Fi data to communicate with a Raspberry Pi to perform calculations. Future work involves a \textbf{KNN}-based \textbf{Machine Learning} model in \textbf{Python} to train the software. \\
\textbf{\underline{Cyclic Load Tester}}: In a team of five, we designed and built a cyclic load tester to apply repeated stress on metals using a sound woofer, power amplifier, and arduino connected load cell. \\
\textbf{\underline{MATLAB Personal Portfolio GUI}}: In a team of three, we created a functional GUI which gave the user a stock portfolio for choosing stocks that were analyzed via markowitz mean-variance analysis.
